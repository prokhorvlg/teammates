# Firstbase Frontend Coding Challenge
Welcome to the Firstbase Frontend Coding Challenge.

All of the instructions to complete this challenge are found in this readme. If you have any questions please e-mail the hiring manager you are working with.

## Objectives
* Assessing experience with Typescript
* Assessing experience with ReactJS
* Assessing experience with Testing in React Projects
* Asessing an understanding of best practices for ReactJS and Typescript development

## The Challenge
You will build a react js application that allows a user to view, edit, and search an employee directory. The employee directory is implemented with a GraphQL API located in this git repository.

### Use Cases
* As a user I should be able to view the entire employee directory
* As a user I should be able to edit an employee
* As a user I should be able to search for employees with a search bar (client side)
* As a user I should be able to view all the information for a single employee

No image uploading is required here. The API doesn't support it.


The design and presentation of this is entirely up to you. Remember this is a chance to show off your skills.
